Rebellion is perhaps among the deepest roots of science: the refusal to accept the present order of things.10 Among those who took the fatal decision was a friend of Robespierre called Lazare Carnot. Carnot had a passion for the great Persian poet Saadi Shirazi. Captured and enslaved at Acre by the Crusaders, Shirazi is the author of those luminous verses that now stand at the entrance of the headquarters of the United Nations:  \n  \n\n\n \n>  All of the sons of Adam are part of one single body,   \n>  They are of the same essence.   \n>  When time afflicts us with pain   \n> \n> \n>    en: regicide: regicide\n\n en: afflict: afflicts",
