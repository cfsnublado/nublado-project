- The time indicated by a particular clock measuring a particular phenomenon is called “proper time” in physics. Every clock has its proper time. Every phenomenon that occurs has its proper time, its own rhythm.

    Einstein has given us the equations that describe how proper times develop relative to each other. He has shown us how to calculate the difference between two times.

- Past and future are different from each other. Cause precedes effect. Pain comes after a wound, not before it. The glass shatters into a thousand pieces, and the pieces do not re-form into a glass. We cannot change the past; we can have regrets, remorse, memories. The future instead is uncertainty, desire, anxiety, open space, destiny, perhaps. We can live toward it, shape it, because it does not yet exist. Everything is still possible. . . . Time is not a line with two equal directions: it is an arrow with different extremities.

- It all began with a regicide. On January 16, 1793, the National Convention in Paris sentenced Louis XVI to death. Rebellion is perhaps among the deepest roots of science: the refusal to accept the present order of things.10 Among those who took the fatal decision was a friend of Robespierre called Lazare Carnot. Carnot had a passion for the great Persian poet Saadi Shirazi. Captured and enslaved at Acre by the Crusaders, Shirazi is the author of those luminous verses that now stand at the entrance of the headquarters of the United Nations:<br><br>

    > All of the sons of Adam are part of one single body,  
They are of the same essence.  
When time afflicts us with pain  
In one part of that body  
All the other parts feel it too.  
If you fail to feel the pain of others  
You do not deserve the name of man.

- The crucial point here is the difference from what happens with falling bodies: a ball may fall, but it can also come back up, by rebounding, for instance. Heat cannot.

    This is the _only_ basic law of physics that distinguishes the past from the future.

- If a sequence of events is allowed by these equations, so is the same sequence run backward in time. In the elementary equations of the world, the arrow of time appears _only_ where there is heat. The link between time and heat is therefore fundamental: every time a difference is manifested between the past and the future, heat is involved. In every sequence of events that becomes absurd if projected backward, there is something that is heating up.

- Only where there is heat is there a distinction between past and future. Thoughts, for instance, unfold from the past to the future, not vice versa&mdash;and, in fact, thinking produces heat in our heads. . . .

- Clausius introduces a quantity that measures this irreversible progress of heat in only one direction and, since he was a cultivated German, he gives it a name taken from ancient Greek&mdash;_entropy_:<br><br>

    > I prefer to take the names of important scientific quantities from ancient languages, so that they may be the same in all the living languages. I therefore propose to call entropy the quantity (S) of a body, from the Greek word for transformation: ἡ τροπὴ.

- Clausius’s entropy, indicated by the letter S, is a measurable and calculable quantity that increases or remains the same but never decreases, in an isolated process. In order to indicate that it never decreases, we write:

        ΔS ≥ 0

    This reads: “Delta S is always greater than or equal to zero,” and we call this “the second principle of thermodynamics” (the first being the conservation of energy). Its nub is the fact that heat passes only from hot bodies to cold, never the other way around.

- We see the water in a glass like the astronauts saw the Earth from the moon: calm, gleaming, blue. From the moon, they could see nothing of the exuberant agitation of life on Earth, its plants and animals, desires and despairs. Only a veined blue ball. Within the reflections in a glass of water, there is an analogous tumultuous life, made up of the activities of myriads of molecules—many more than there are living beings on Earth.

- Boltzmann has shown that entropy exists because we describe the world in a blurred fashion. He has demonstrated that entropy is precisely the quantity that counts how many are the different configurations that our blurred vision does not distinguish between. Heat, entropy, and the lower entropy of the past are notions that belong to an approximate, statistical description of nature.

- This is the disconcerting conclusion that emerges from Boltzmann’s work: the difference between the past and the future refers only to our own blurred vision of the world. It’s a conclusion that leaves us flabbergasted: is it really possible that a perception so vivid, basic, existential&mdash;my perception of the passage of time&mdash;depends on the fact that I cannot apprehend the world in all of its minute detail? On a kind of distortion that’s produced by myopia? Is it true that, if I could see exactly and take into consideration the actual dance of millions of molecules, then the future would be “just like” the past? Is it possible that I have as much knowledge of the past&mdash;or ignorance of it&mdash;as I do of the future? Even allowing for the fact that our perceptions of the world are frequently wrong, can the world really be so profoundly different from our perception of it as this?

- A moving object therefore experiences a shorter duration than a stationary one: a watch marks fewer seconds, a plant grows more slowly, a young man dreams less. For a moving object, time contracts.* Not only is there no single time for different places—there is not even a single time for any particular place. A duration can be associated only with the movement of something, with a given trajectory.

    “Proper time” depends not only on where you are and your degree of proximity to masses; it depends also on the speed at which you move.

- The idea that a well-defined _now_ exists throughout the universe is an illusion, an illegitimate extrapolation of our own experience.

    It is like the point where the rainbow touches the forest. We think that we can see it&mdash;but if we go to look for it, it isn’t there.

- Mathematicians have a term for the order established by filiation: “partial order.” A partial order establishes a relation of before and after between certain elements, but not between any two of them. Human beings form a “partially ordered” set (not a “completely ordered” set) through filiation. Filiation establishes an order (before the descendants, after the forebears), but not between everyone.

- To see how this order works, we need only think of a family tree, like this one for Gorgo. There is a cone-shaped “past” made up of her forebears, and a “future” cone comprising her descendants. Those who are neither ancestors nor descendants remain outside of the cones.
Every human being has their own past cone of ancestors and future cone of descendants.

- More than a hundred years have passed since we learned that the “present of the universe” does not exist. And yet this continues to confound us and still seems difficult to conceptualize. Every so often a physicist mutinies and tries to show that it isn’t true. Philosophers continue to discuss the disappearance of the present. Today, there are often conferences devoted to the subject.

- It can hardly be pure coincidence that, before gaining a university position, the young Einstein worked in the Swiss patent office, dealing specifically with patents relating to the synchronization of clocks at railway stations. It was probably there that it dawned on him: the problem of synchronizing clocks was, ultimately, an insoluble one.

- For millennia before clocks, our only regular way of measuring time had been the alternation of day and night. The rhythm of day followed by night also regulates the lives of plants and animals. Diurnal rhythms are ubiquitous in the natural world. They are essential to life, and it seems to me probable that they played a key role in the very origin of life on Earth, since an oscillation is required to set a mechanism in motion. Living organisms are full of clocks of various kinds—molecular, neuronal, chemical, hormonal—each of them more or less in tune with the others. There are chemical mechanisms that keep to a twenty-four-hour rhythm even in the biochemistry of single cells.
