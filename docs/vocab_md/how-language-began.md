- Language is the interaction of meaning (semantics), conditions on usage (pragmatics), the physical properties of its inventory of sounds (phonetics), a grammar (syntax, or sentence structure), phonology (sound structure), morphology (word structure), discourse conversational organisational principles, information and gestures. Language is a gestalt – the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. That is to say, the whole is not understood merely by examining its individual components.

- The course followed by humans on the path to language was a progression through natural signs to human symbols. Signs and symbols are explained in reference to a theory of ‘semiotics’ in the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce. C. S. Peirce was perhaps the most brilliant American philosopher in history. He contributed to mathematics, to science, to the study of language and to philosophy. He is the founder of two separate fields of study: semiotics – the study of signs – and pragmatism – the only uniquely American school of philosophy. In spite of his brilliance, he was never able to secure long-term employment because he was cantankerous and rebellious against social mores. Peirce’s semiotics did not concern itself directly with the evolution of language. But it turns out to be the best model of the stages of linguistic evolution.

- Peirce’s theory indirectly predicts a progression of signs from natural signs (indexes), to icons, to human-created symbols.* This progression moves to an increasing complexity of types of sign and the evolutionary progression of Homo species’ language abilities. A sign is any pairing of a form (such as a word, a smell, a sound, a street sign, or Morse code) with a meaning (what the sign refers to). An index, as the most primitive part of the progression, is a form that manifests an actual physical link to what it refers to. The footprint of a cat is an index: it indicates, makes us expect to see, a cat. The smell of a grilling steak brings the steak and the grill to mind. Smoke indexes fire. An icon is something that physically evokes what it refers to: a sculpture or portrait references its subject via a physical resemblance. An onomatopoeic word like ‘bam’ or ‘clang’ brings to mind those sounds.

- Symbols are conventional links to what they refer to. They are more complicated than other signs because they need not bear any resemblance to nor any physical connection to what they refer to. They are agreed upon by society. The numeral ‘3’ refers to the cardinality of three objects just as ‘Dan’ refers to someone of that name, not because the word ‘three’ bears a physical connection or resemblance to cardinality, nor because all people named Dan have any physical characteristic in common. This arbitrary, conventional association of form and meaning is exactly what renders symbols the beginning of language and evidence for social norms. Symbols are the original social contract.

- Once humans had symbols, certain portions of those symbols became more meaningful than other parts. If I randomly choose to write an S as Ŝ or a P as Ṕ in English prose, native English readers will disregard the embellishments, recognising immediately that the additions are irrelevant. But if I write S as P, then this will cause confusion. This is because the meaningful parts of symbols cannot be changed without obscuring their identity, though non-meaningful parts may change with impunity. Symbols are, therefore, not simplex atoms but contain ‘junk’ portions (the parts that are non-essential to their meaning) alongside crucial information. For Peirce this information was crucial for the ‘interpretant’ or meaning of the sign.

- > In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there … There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use … Every indication of contrivance, every manifestation of design, which existed in the watch, exists in the works of nature; with the difference, on the side of nature, of being greater or more, and that in a degree which exceeds all computation.

- The earth is roughly 4.5 billion years old and probably began as a whirling cloud, cooling and solidifying, its waters gradually ending their cycle of rain and evaporation, reducing the surface temperature of our red planet enough to accumulate in turbulent, lifeless, hot oceans inhospitable to all life, in the Precambrian period’s Archaean Eon. But phosphates, sugars, nitrogen were about in the oceanic stew, and from these the first carbohydrates and other building blocks of life were formed. At least, that is one possible explanation.

- If one considers the earth from its beginning until today, 99.997 per cent of the planet’s history had passed before the Pleistocene (2.8 million years ago), when Homo habilis (or Homo erectus, depending on classification) the first species of the genus Homo, emerged. Species such as sapiens arose even later. The period in which the earliest hominins gave rise to modern humans, began from the late Miocene (23–5.3 million years ago), through the Pliocene (5.3–2.8 million years ago) and the Pleistocene, up until the current age, the Holocene (11,000 years ago).
