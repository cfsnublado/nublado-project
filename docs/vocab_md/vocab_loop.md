### The Beginning of Infinity

- For example, a rule that is expressed in elegant rhyme may be remembered, and repeated, better than one that is more accurate but expressed in ungainly prose. (prose, elegant, accurate, ungainly)

- And in this way he elevated that formerly harmless misconception into a central flaw in his philosophy, namely the doctrine that certain truths about the physical world could be "known a priori" &mdash; that is to say, without doing science. And of course, to make matters worse, by "known" he unfortunately meant "justified."

- Consequently, the reliability of our knowledge of mathematics remains for ever subsidiary to that of our knowledge of physical reality.

- So, contrary to what Hilbert thought, and contrary to what most mathematicians since antiquity have believed and believe to this day, proof theory can never be made into a branch of mathematics. Proof theory is a science: specifically, it is computer science.

- They seem plausible only because they rely on that standard mistake of Zeno’s, applied to computation: the misconception that the set of classically computable functions has an a-priori privileged status within mathematics. But it does not. The only thing that privileges that set of operations is that it is instantiated in the laws of physics.

- Problems are conflicts between ideas.

- A mathematician studying an undecidable question may _prove_ that it is undecidable (and explain why). From the mathematician’s point of view, that is a success. Though it does not answer the _mathematical question_, it solves the _mathematician’s problem_. Even working on a mathematical problem without any of those kinds of success is still not the same as failing to create knowledge. Whenever one tries and fails to solve a mathematical problem one has discovered a theorem &mdash; and usually also an explanation &mdash; about why that approach to solving it does not work.

- Proof is a physical process: whether a mathematical proposition is provable or unprovable, decidable or undecidable, depends on the laws of physics, which determine which abstract entities and relationships are modelled by physical objects.

- Everyone knows that man is the paragon of animals. But if this epistemology you tell me is true, the we are infinitely more marvellous creatures than that. Here we sit, forever imprisoned in the dark, amlost-sealed cave of our skull, _guessing_.

- It _is_ consistent for two identical entities to become different under determinisitc and symmetrical laws. But, for that to happen, they must initially be more than just exact images of each other: they must be _fungible_ (the g is prounded as in "plunger"), by which I mean identical in lierally every way except that there are two of them.

- Dollars in bank accounts are what may be called "configurational" entities: they are states or configurations of objects, not what we usually think of as physical objects in their own right. Your bank balance resides in the _state_ of a certain information-storage device.

### I am a Strange Loop.

Now suppose that my mother had placed the needle in the groove a millisecond later. One thing for sure is that all the molecules in the room would have moved completely differently. If you had been one of those molecules, you would have had a wildly different life story. Thanks to that millisecond delay, you would have careened and bashed into completely different molecules in utterly different places, spun off in totally different directions, and on and on, ad infinitum. No matter which molecule you were in the room, your life story would have turned out unimaginably different. But would any of that have made an iota of difference to the life story of the kid listening to the music? No — not the teensiest, tiniest iota of difference.

A slight slippage of subterranean stone that obliterates 20,000 people in some far-off land, the ceaseless plundering of virgin jungles in the Amazon basin, a swarm of helpless stars being swallowed up on after another by a ravenous black hole, even an ongoing collision between two huge galaxies each of which contains a hundred billion stars &mdash; such colossal events are so abstract to someone like me that they can't even touch the sense of urgency and importance, and thus the _reality_, of some measly little hangnail on my left hand's pinky.

I found that each envelope was empty. So what in tarnation was going on?

Eventually it dawned on methat there wasn't any marble in there at all, but that there was something that _felt_ for all the world exactly like a marble to this old marble hand. It was an _epiphenomenon_ caused by the fact that, for each envelope, at the vertex of the "V" made by its flap, there is a triple layer of paper as well as a thin layer of glue.


And so the idea of "describability" without restriction to some specific hierarchical level was a chimera, declared Russell, believing he had discovered a profound new truth.

Moving on, what counts as a "heavenly body"? Do we count artificial satellites? And random pieces of flotsam and jetsam left floating out there by astronauts? Do we count every single asteroid? Every single distinct stone floating in Saturn's rings?

What about the theory of twisting tendrils of plants?


To sum up, the notion of an "English-language definition of an integer" turns out to be a hopeless morass, and so Berry's twisty notion of _b_, no less than Escher's twisty notion of two mutually drawing hands, is an ingenious figment of the imagination rather than a geniune strange loop.

It was in the air that truly peculiar things could happen when modern cousins of various ancient paradoxes cropped up inside the rigorously logical world of numbers, a world in which nothing of the sort had ever been seen before, a prisine paradise in which no one had dreamt paradox might arise.

At first this vision of miraculous synchrony was just a little spark, but Gödel quickly realized that his inchoate dream might be made so precise that it could be spelled out to others, so he started pursuing it in a dogged fashion.


Though extremely recondite, the reason behind the infinite mutual-avoidance dance had been found. This is just one more triumph of the Mathematician's Credo &mdash; one more reason to buy a lot of stock in the idea that in mathematics, _where there's a pattern, there's a reason._

In fact, it reminded him of the fact that theorems in _PM_ (like theorems in Euclid's _Elements_) always spring (by formal rules of inference) from earlier theorems in _PM_, with the exception of the first few theorems, which are declared by fiat to be theorems, and thus are called "axioms" (analogues to the seeds).
